We don't blame you one bit. In fact, we'll help you. Here are some of our top picks for the hottest spots in Miami Beach. </p><p><strong>LIV</strong><br><em>4441 Collins Avenue</em> <br><em>Miami Beach, Florida 33140</em></p><p>Easily Miami's most famous nightclub, LIV hosts not only some of the world's most prominent DJs, but also the country's most high-profile celebrities. Don't be surprised if you catch Chris Brown or Justin Bieber hosting, and always expect to find Cedric Gervais and Steve Angello spinning one night or another. With 18,000 square feet of neon opulence and 360-degree views, LIV is the epitome of Miami nightlife. Check the <a href=\"http://www.livnightclub.com/index.php/main/events\" target=\"_blank\">upcoming schedule</a> to see who's playing. </p><p><strong>Bodega</strong><br><em>1220 16th Street</em><br><em>Miami Beach, Florida 33139</em> </p><p>We could rave about Bodega's inconspicuous, speakeasy-style lounge, live music, and Latin beats, but what makes this spot stand out are its tacos. No longer do you have to stumble out of the club in search of the late-night munchies, Mexico's ultimate drunk food awaits you in Bodega's storefront - that is, of course, when you finally stop dancing. Once you pass through that meat locker door, it will be hard to stop - trust us. </p><p><strong>Twist</strong><br><em>1057 Washington Avenue</em><br><em>Miami Beach, Florida 33139 </em></p><p>If you want to dance your heart out, head to <a href=\"http://www.twistsobe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twist</a>. At South Beach's most famous gay club, you can count on some serious moves. With multiple dance floors and different rooms spinning different tunes, from EDM to pop, hip-hop and salsa, there's something for whatever you feel like dancing to. Even better, there's no cover or dress code - a rarity in Miami nightlife. </p><p><strong>Mokai</strong><br><em>235 23rd Street</em><br><em>Miami Beach, Florida 33139</em></p><p>Not to be outdone, <a href=\"http://www.mokaimiami.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mokai</a> celebrity parties ooze exclusivity. Known for their Mokai Mondays, this Miami lounge offers a healthy mix of pop and hip-hop for Miami's finest. Don't be shied away by the amateurs complaining they couldn't get in, any guest of WPH shouldn't have a problem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Icon</strong><br><em>1235 Washington Avenue<br>Miami Beach, Florida 33139</em></p><p>A newcomer to the South Beach scene, Icon has the set-up (and the neon) to rival LIV in true Miami fashion. Yet <a href=\"http://iconmiami.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Icon</a> isn't that new. Rising from the ashes of Miami's long-running Mansion, Icon brings a fresh perspective to SoBe nightlife mixing Art Deco design and state-of-the-art light shows. Just down the street from WPH, Icon practically demands a visit.</p>","image":{"url":"/assets/images/blog/favorite-clubs-in-miami-beach.jpg"}}
