                    <p> As if Miami needed an excuse to dress-up (or down), Halloween is the holiday that best fits that bill in the Magic City. From beach parties, to haunted carnivals, club extravaganzas, and exclusive yacht soirees, Miami’s Halloween debauchery comes in just about any form. That said, these are the events we’re looking forward to throughout the month of October. </p>

                    <p> <strong>Halloween at Lincoln Road Mall</strong> <br>
                    Monday, October 31, 2016</p>

                    <p> By far the largest Halloween party in South Beach, this block party has become synonymous with Halloween in Miami. Held outside of Lincoln Road Mall, party-goers can pop in and out of bars and restaurants, and admire ingenuous costumes and perfect tans. After all, this is South Beach and Halloween is its night – <span class="textitalic">Lincoln Road Mall, Miami Beach, FL 33139.</span> </p>

                     <p><strong>Hallowyn</strong> <br>

                     <p>If you’re of the more alternative variety, you can head over to the mainland’s artist enclave and celebrate in Wynwood. Also a block party, <a href="http://hallowynblockparty.com/" target="_blank"> Hallowyn  </a> boasts area’s best food trucks and VJs to keep the party going til the wee hours of the morning.

Think about it. <span class="textitalic">– 2250 NW 2nd Avenue, Miami, FL 33127 </span> </p>


                     <p><strong>House of Horror</strong> <br>
                    Daily, times vary </p>

                     <p>If you’re looking for something a little more Halloween-themed, there’s the  <a href="http://houseofhorrorpark.com/" target="_blank">  House of Horror </a> haunted carnival. With two haunted houses on the carnival grounds, including one 3D experience, a freak show museum, a haunted theatre, carnival rides and even a concert by the Chainsmokers, this Halloween event is well worth the trek to Doral. Park grounds open at 5:30 p.m. on weekends and at 6:00 p.m. weekdays throughout the month of October  <span class="textitalic"> - 1455 NW 107 Avenue, Miami, FL 33172, (305) 639-6000 </span> </p>

                  <div class="post-date">November 27th, 2016 – December 4th, 2016</div>
                  <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/art-basel.jpg" alt="Art Basel – Miami Art Week 2016" title="Art Basel – Miami Art Week 2016"/>

                  </p>

                   <p>The show that put Miami on the international art map, <a href="https://www.artbasel.com/miami-beach" target="_blank">  Art Basel </a> is one of Miami’s premiere events. Since 2002, Miami Beach has been the spot to see Art Basel’s more than 200 international galleries on display. This is very much the who’s who of the art scene, not only in the Americas, but the world. From curators to collectors, directors and patrons, this is where the art world comes to do business…and where they come to play.  </p>

                    <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/art-basel2.jpg" alt="Art Basel – Miami Art Week 2016" title="Art Basel – Miami Art Week 2016"/>

                  </p>

                   <p>Held at the Miami Convention Center, Art Basel draws visitors in the tens of thousands. Peruse the aisles of the world’s finest art while sipping champagne or venture out to one of the many satellite fairs held in conjunction with Art Basel. Luckily for us, and lucky for you (if you take advantage of our <a href="https://wphsouthbeach.reztrip.com/classic/en/special_offer?action=show&controller=landings&locale=en&rate_code=ABMB16&rate_code=ABMB16&vr=3" target="_blank">Art Basel discount </a>), WPH is located in the heart of Art Basel and some of our favorite satellite fairs. This year we’re especially looking forward to a few in particular. </p>

                   <p>Just crossing Collins Street from WPH is <a href="https://scope-art.com/" target="_blank"> SCOPE</a>, the contemporary art fair on the beach. With ocean views and some serious production, SCOPE is one of the biggest names at Art Basel – and one those that you must see.  </p>

                  </p>


                   <p>Keeping with the theme of contemporary art, another Art Basel fair we’re looking forward to is NADA. However,<strong> NADA</strong> takes a different approach to Art Basel. Instead,  <a href="https://www.newartdealers.org/" target="_blank"> NADA </a> focuses on curating art outside of the art establishment. Founded with the intention of assembling a unique and alternative space in the art scene, NADA always produces something exciting each year, making it worth the visit. </p>

                   <p>However, if you really want to switch it up at Art Basel, consider both INK and Superfine! While printmaking tends to get pushed to the back burner at many museums and galleries –that doesn’t happen at   <a href="http://www.inkartfair.com/about.html" target="_blank">  INK.</a> INK is solely dedicated to works on paper, whether they’re freehand or lithography. And being part of Art Basel, you know these printmakers are the best of the best. Another unique approach is <strong> Superfine!</strong>. <a href="http://superfine.world/#superfine" target="_blank"> Superfine! </a>is a breath of fresh air in the Art Basel scene. Trek over to Wynwood for an original display by dedicated artists, making art for a living, not for the lifestyle. No pretension here, just creativity.  </p>

                  

                   <p>And even if you’re not that up on art, the rooftop, garden, and pool <a href=" http://www.miamiandbeaches.com/events/art-basel/where-to-party-during-art-basel" target="_blank">  </a> parties are sure to have something for you. Pack your museum shoes. You’ll be needing them.  </p>

                   <p class="textitalic">Until October 15, 2016, WPH will be offering discounts on rooms during Miami Art Week. Discounts on rooms are available for rooms booked from November 27, 2016 to December 3, 2016.

                  <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/wynwood.jpg" alt="Washington Park Picks – What to Do in Wynwood" title="Washington Park Picks – What to Do in Wynwood"/></p>
                  <p>There’s nothing hotter than Wynwood right now. <a href="http://www.wynwoodmiami.com/" target="_blank"> Wynwood </a>has taken some of Miami’s most drab and abandoned warehouses and revitalized them into the city’s most creative space. In the same way Art Deco revitalized a hurricane-torn South Beach, world-renown street artists have given new life to an area that was once plagued by high levels of unemployment and disrepair. </p>
                  <p><strong>Wynwood Walls</strong><br>
                    2520 NW 2nd Street<br>
                    Miami, FL 33127
                  </p>
                  <p>One man’s former warehouse is another artist’s blank canvas, or so thought Tony Goldman - the brains behind the spot that put Wynwood on the map. Thanks to Goldman’s  <a href="http://www.thewynwoodwalls.com/" target="_blank"> Wynwood Walls</a> and the internationally-acclaimed artists responsible for them, this outdoor art project has almost single-handedly revitalized an area that had fallen into disrepair. Not only is it one of the most unique exhibitions by some of the finest street artists known today, it’s also an iconic testament to the power of art to literally change the world.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Panther Coffee</strong><br>
                    2390 NW 2nd Avenue<br>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is another iconic Wynwood spot. Easily the neighborhood’s de facto meeting point,  <a href="http://www.panthercoffee.com/" target="_blank">Panther Coffee</a> has made a name for itself with its unique roast and fair-trade beans, sourced from around the world. Considering that this spot is so Wynwood, expect an extra spoonful of hip with your latte art and some serious knowledge about the beans you’re imbibing. Nevertheless, it’s the perfect place to get a crash course on the neighborhood. Monday – Saturday, 7 a.m. – 9 p.m., Sunday 8 a.m. – 9 p.m.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Bakehouse Art Complex</strong><br>
                    561 NW 32 Street<br>
                    Miami, FL 33127
                  </p>
                  <p>A mainstay of the Wynwood art scene, this former-bakery-turned-artist-incubator has been pumping out quality pieces since its inception in the late 1980s. Not only does it provide a residency program to cultivate emerging artists and aid established ones, <a href="http://www.bacfl.org/" target="_blank">  Bakehouse </a> also functions as an exhibition and performance space, much to the liking of Miami’s vibrant art scene. Open daily from 12 – 5 p.m. Free admission

                  <p><strong>Wood Tavern</strong><br>

                  <p>You can’t really go wrong at  <a href="http://woodtavern.com/" target="_blank">  Wood Tavern </a>. With food trucks fashioned out of old cars on the back patio and music that’s always on point, this spot functions well for a drink, dinner, or even a night out. While the tavern’s popularity has grown quite a bit in the past few years, you can still spare yourself the crowds on most weekday afternoons. And if you need more prodding – every Tuesday is free Taco Tuesday and their popular Sunday-Funday bash, Backyard Boogie, comes highly recommended, as well. Tuesday – Saturday 5 p.m. – 3 a.m., Sunday 5 -11 p.m.

                  <p>Part gallery, part shop, <a href="http://plantthefuture.com/" target="_blank">  Plant the Future </a> takes Wynwood’s revitalization efforts to heart. Fusing art, horticulture, and even architecture, this shop offers a wide array of exotic plants, unique terrariums, and conceptualist designs in one of the most calming spaces in all of Miami. Blanketed in white, Plant the Future is like walking into a surreal jungle.

                  <div class="post-date">September 23rd to October 15th, 2016</div>

                  <p><strong>Washington Park Picks – Miami’s Octoberfest Events</strong></p>
                  <p>Munich may be an 11-hour-flight away, but that doesn’t mean Miami slouches on Octoberfest. If fact, Miami has quite a few events centered around the German holiday. After all, who doesn’t like cold beer in a hot climate, not to mention brats off the grill and pretzels with spicy mustard? That said, here are a few of the events we’re looking forward to this Octoberfest season.  </p>
                  <p><strong>Oktoberfest at Miami Beach Botanical Garden – Friday, September 23, 7 p.m.</strong></p>
                  <p>Definitely more of a local vibe, this is the second-annual Oktoberfest at the Miami Beach Botanical Garden. Putting a Miami spin on the German biergarten, this festival promise lawn games, pies, polka, and bratwursts. It’s also serious about its local brewers. Expect unlimited beer from Wynwood Brewery, Edukos Miami, Concrete Beach Brewery, J. Wakefield, and more. – 2000 Convention Center Drive, Miami Beach, FL</p>
                  <p><strong>Sam Adams Octoberfest – Friday, September 30 – Sunday, October 2, 2016</strong></p>
                  <p>The Sam Adams Octoberfest differs from the others in quite a few ways. First off, there’s no entrance fee like at the other festivals. Second, it’s a three-day festival. Third, it’s all Sam Adams Octoberfest beer - no local breweries here. That said, the Sam Adams Octoberfest draws inspiration from Munich beer halls with traditional German decorations, beer steins, and Barvarian hats with the purchase of Sam Adams popular seasonal beer. – Wynwood, NW 2nd Avenue & NW 22nd Lane, Miami, FL</p>
                  <p><strong>Octoberfest at Marlin’s Park – Saturday, October 1, 2016, 3 p.m. – 9 p.m.</strong></p>
                  <p>This is the carnival of all Miami Octoberfests. With a ferris wheel, dunk tank, giant jenga, and a zip line, this festival is more adult playground than German feast, but hey, we’re not complaining. While there are some polkas to be heard at the start the festival, the real party starts once the DJs come on. A ticket gets you unlimited beer – 501 Marlin’s Way, Miami, FL</p>
                  <p><strong>Grovetoberfest – Saturday, October 15, 2016, 4 p.m. – 7 p.m.</strong></p>
                  <p>Grovetoberfest is the beer-snob’s Octoberfest. As the largest craft beer festival in Florida, and in both the number of attendees and craft beers, this festival is the place to try all those beers you’ve been meaning to get your hands on. And with 300 beers to choose from, including local brews and home brews, we’re sure even the snobs will find something they like. – Miami Marine Stadium, 3501 Rickenbacker Causeway, Key Biscayne, FL</p>

                  <div class="post-date">September 1st, 2016</div>
                  <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/lead-beekman-1802.jpg" alt="Lead Beekman 1802" title="Lead Beekman 1802"/></p>
                  <p>Thanks to Beekman 1802, WPH has some of the most luxurious bath products around. Made from goat milk fresh off the Beekman farm, WPH bath amenities provide some serious moisturization, as well as some well-deserved appreciation for the good things in life. Yet there’s much more to <a href="https://beekman1802.com/" target="_blank">Beekman 1802</a> than great products. We caught up with Brent Ridge of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FabulousBeekmanBoys/" target="_blank">Fabulous Beekman Boys</a> to find out just how they created an empire built on life’s little luxuries.</p>
                  <p> <strong>Let's start with the history. How do you go from urban professional to farming? That's a pretty big leap.</strong></p>
                  <p>Well, my partner Josh and I had both been living and working in New York City. We bought this farm property in upstate New York thinking it was going to be our weekend getaway from the city, but we ended up both losing our jobs within six months of one another in the recession of 2008.</p>
                  <p>So, we had to figure out a way to make the farm sustain itself because we had a huge mortgage. Turns out, there was another local farmer who was losing his farm, too, and he had asked if he could bring <a href="shop.beekman1802.com/blogs/news/12748233-live-baby-goat-cam-win-a-dropcam-of-your-own" target="_blank">his goats</a> to the property to graze.  We took him in and literally started our company by googling “what can we make with goat milk.” And that’s how we learned to make the <a href="shop.beekman1802.com/collections/bar-soaps" target="_blank">goat milk soap</a>, which was our first product.</p>
                  <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/beekman-farm.jpg" alt="Beekman Farm" title="Beekman Farm"/></p>
                  <p> <strong>With your background in geriatric medicine you’ve always been involved in holistic health in some way. Have you incorporated this approach to Beekman 1802?</strong></p>
                  <p>Oh absolutely. Well, you know, we want to improve your life. But one product doesn't improve someone's life. The product has to be one component of a whole approach to life - that's what we're really trying to do with the content we produce on <a href="https://beekman1802.com/" target="_blank">our website</a> or in the Beekman 1802 Almanac or through our social media content. We really hope that people take the holistic approach to living and appreciating because all of those things do impact your well-being.</p>
                  <p><strong>What drew you to the farm in Sharon Springs?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think for me, as a person who's part of the rat race, and after living several years in a big urban area, you really do feel like you need to have a place to get away, for the sake of your sanity. That really was the idea.
                  </p>
                  <p>When we initially bought the farm, we were going to use it on the weekends. We wanted to have a garden and grow some of our own food and carry it back into the city with us for the week. That was our simple plan.  And then life changed and we had to come up with another plan.</p>
                  <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/goats.jpg" alt="goats" title="Goats"/></p>
                  <p><strong>So you almost lost the farm in 2008 – and then you turned it around. What did you learn from the experience?
                  </strong></p>
                  <p>I think for us it really does go back to that idea of appreciation. I think for a large part, Americans, more so than any other culture, are used to instant gratification. If you need a piece of information, you google it and you know the answer immediately, or you want something and you order it and immediately Amazon ships it out. It’s great, it makes life more convenient, but you also lose your appreciation for things.</p>
                  <p>There’s some truth to that adage that absence makes the heart grow fonder. The absence of things makes you appreciate them more. Moving to a farm in a very small community, where we didn’t have a lot of the things we had in New York City really made us appreciate those things so much more. Even now, when business takes us into New York City or any major city we actually appreciate it.</p>
                  <p>And we learned that lesson from our life on the farm and from growing our own food. When we run out of the tomatoes that we’ve canned or frozen or dehydrated, we know that we won’t have another tomato again until the end of September. And when you finally taste a tomato it tastes like the most delicious thing you’ve ever had because you haven't had it. You appreciate it more.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Was it an adjustment to move from the big city to a small town?</strong></p>
                  <p>You know, it's funny because when you live in New York City, whatever part of the city you live in becomes your community.  Whether you’re on the Upper West Side, SoHo, or West Village - those are, in and of themselves, small towns. You have the dry cleaner you go to, the grocery store you go to; you have the movie theater you go to. So in a lot of respects it was very similar.</p>
                  <p>I think what was challenging for us - and what has continued to be challenging - is starting a company, which is now shipping worldwide, but is still based in this little village that doesn't have the infrastructure to support a company that's growing as quickly as ours. That’s been the biggest challenge of moving out of the city.

                  <p><strong>Let’s talk about the partnership with WPH. How did that come about?</strong></p>
                  <p>We had started developing our goat milk amenity products about three years ago for luxury hotels. It was actually Jeff Toscano came across our product and was interested in bringing it in. He reached out to us, and now we even have plans to open up a little kiosk of our products in the lobby when WPH has its grand opening later this year.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>What's next for Beekman 1802?</strong></p>
                  <p>One of the other interesting things that our company is doing right now is creating travel experiences. So what we do is design experiences for people who have all the pillars of Beekman 1802 - appreciation of food, of agriculture, appreciation of life's little luxuries, and giving back. Last year we designed a trip to Cuba. This year we just designed a trip to India. It’s this idea of having people experience what a brand is all about, which I know is so critical in the hotel industry.  I know that's exactly what WPH wants to do - completely immerse people in what they think they experience of the hotel should be.</p>

                  <h2 class="blog-heading">Washington Park Picks – SoBe Parks</h2>
                  <div class="post-date">August 23rd, 2016</div>
                  <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/sobe-parks.jpg" alt="Washington Park Picks – SoBe Parks" title="Washington Park Picks – SoBe Parks"/></p>
                  <p>Miami is gorgeous. And no, we’re not just talking about the people and the art deco architecture. Miami is filled with plenty of natural beauty – beautiful public spaces, many of which are within a close proximity to WPH. So grab one of our Maritone bikes and set off into the sunset. These are our favorite picks for parks in the South Beach area.</p>
                  <p> <strong>Lummus Park</strong> <br>
                    Ocean Drive, between 10th & 11th Streets <br>
                    Miami Beach, Florida 33139<br>
                  </p>
                  <p> Easily the most famous SoBe park, Lummus Park has been the sight of many a movie and many a happening. Set in between Ocean Drive and Miami’s blue-green waters, this park is never without it its fair share of beach-goers. There are always bikers on the trails and groups playing volleyball. Look for the eye candy training in the park or the beauties bathing in the sun. This is one of those SoBe spots you can’t miss. </p>
                  <p> <strong>South Pointe Park </strong><br>
                    1 Washington Avenue <br>
                  Miami Beach, Florida 33139 </p>
                  <p> The southernmost point of South Beach, this park has some of the most gorgeous views in all of Miami. Surrounded by water on almost all sides, South Pointe Park is ideal for seeing both the sunrise and sunset. It’s also home to one of our favorite patios at Smith & Wollensky, making for a great space to watch the cruise ships come in with a cocktail in hand. This is a peaceful as South Beach gets.
                    <p> <strong>Palm Island Park</strong> <br>
                      159 Palm Avenue <br>
                    Miami Beach, Florida 33139 </p>
                    <p> This is a great little park tucked away from the dance beats and neon. Part of the gated community of the same name, Palm Island Park has tennis courts, handball courts and a basketball court rated the “Best Basketball Court” by the Miami New Times – and it’s still on the water. Despite the security guarding the entrance, this park is open to the public and maintained by the City of Miami Beach. Strut through with confidence on your way to the courts. </p>
                    <p><strong> Marjory Stoneman Douglas Park </strong><br>
                      Ocean Drive, between 2nd & 3rd Streets <br>
                    Miami Beach, Florida 33139 </p>
                    <p>Marjory Stoneman Douglas Park is SoBe’s perfect picnic spot. Although it is located on the beach, this park feels like an oasis with its tall palm trees and lush green grass, giving it a cooler temperature than Miami’s other spots under the bright sun. Take a book with you or lose yourself in the ocean views. This park won’t be crowded. </p>

                    <p>Although summer means sun, it also means rain for most tropical destinations, Miami included. Luckily in Miami there are plenty of options if you happen to get caught in the rain, and many options located next to WPH. Here are our top choices.</p>
                    <p> <strong>The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum<br>
                      </strong> 1001 Washington Avenue<br>

                    Free admission for all WPH guests</p>
                    <p> By far our favorite museum in all of Miami, <a href="http://www.wolfsonian.org/" target="_blank">the Wolfsonian </a>always has something interesting going on. Whether it’s the cultural backstory of a historical event or an in-depth look at art and design, this museum is guaranteed to have an insightful exhibition and a diverse mix of art unlike anything else you’ve seen before. Check the schedule for the museum’s current displays or get lost in the Wolfsonian’s permanent collections, ranging from roughly the 1850s to the 1950s, with a good emphasis on Art Deco. </p>
                    <p> <strong>Miami Beach Cinematheque<br>
                      </strong> Historic City Hall Building<br>
                      1130 Washington Avenue<br>
                      South Side, Ground Floor<br>
                      Miami Beach, Florida 33139<br>
                    Phone: 305-673-4567</p>
                    <p>Housed in the Historic City Hall building, the<a href="http://mbcinema.com/" target="_blank"> Miami Beach Cinematheque</a> is an art house gem. Featuring independent and foreign films, this theater is a prime spot to view Sundance and Cannes selections, as well as even lesser-known pieces. Aside from the films it shows, it’s also the headquarters of the Miami Beach Film Society.             As it should be, it’s an intimate space ideal for films just begging to be deciphered. After the showing, check out the gallery for a curated selection of rare film memorabilia.</p>
                    <p> <strong> World Erotic Art Museum<br>
                      </strong> 1205 Washington Avenue<br>

                      Phone: 305-532-9336<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Quite possibly the most “exciting” activity on the list, the <a href="http://weam.com/" target="_blank">World Erotic Art Museum</a> is home to a collection of erotic art dating as early as 300 BCE. From numerous depictions of Adam and Eve to Leda and The Swan, some pieces reflect more fine art than others, while some could easily pass as, well, porn. No matter what you’re into there are some interesting depictions here, including Catherine the Great’s personal collection and naughty Disney figurines altered by disgruntled employees. </p>
                    <p> <strong> Washington Park Hotel<br>
                      </strong> 1050 Washington Park <br>

                      Phone: 305-421-6265<br>
                    </p>
                    <p> While all these options are quite perfect for a rainy day in Miami, the best option is right under your nose. The amenities at <a href="http://www.wphsouthbeach.com/rooms.html" target="_blank">Washington Park Hotel</a> grounds make it hard to leave, especially if it’s raining outside. In fact, why leave when you could just stay in bed in a sea of our plush pillows and luxurious sheets? Or flip on the flat screen? Or curl up with your favorite book and cup of hot coffee, already in your WPH room? If you must leave, get soaked in our steaming hot rainfall showers before venturing downstairs. You’ll find slippers and a robe waiting for you, so cozy that you  just might change your mind and order in.</p>

                    <div class="post-date">August 3rd, 2016</div>
                    <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/washington-park-picks-miami-spice.jpg" alt="Washington Park Picks – Miami Spice 2016" title="Washington Park Picks – Miami Spice 2016"/></p>
                    <p>August 1 – September 30, 2016 </p>
                    <p>August just might be the sweetest time to be in Miami. Not only is Miami Spa Month running until the end of August, but starting August 1 is <a href="http://www.miamiandbeaches.com/special-offers/monthly-deals/miami-spice-month" target="_blank">Miami Spice</a>, where world-famous restaurants offer their menus at discounted prices, and acclaimed chefs dream up creative dishes for Miami’s tasting pleasure. It’s this overlap that makes August extra delicious, with the very real possibility of a trip to the spa followed by three-course meal at one of Miami’s best restaurants, all without spending more than $150. </p>
                    <p>Miami Spice works like this: participating restaurants offer special menus consisting of an appetizer, entrée and dessert. Diners can pick and choose from Miami Spice menu, and some restaurants even offer specialty substitutions, or upgrades. Miami Spice offers depend on the restaurant. Reservations are often required and in some cases, Miami Spice menus are only offered on select days. </p>
                    <p>This year, a total of 244 restaurants are participating in Miami Spice, offering lunches for $23 and dinner for $39, tax and gratuity not included. While we’ll be hitting up as many spots as possible, especially our go-to favorites like Yardbird and Sweet Liberty, there are a few new spots in particular we don’t want to miss.</p>
                    <p>Los Fuegos is one restaurant we’re particularly looking forward to. Located on Collins Avenue, this Argentine restaurant serves up the mounds of beef one would expect from the esteemed <a href="http://www.faena.com/miami-beach/restaurants-and-bars/los-fuegos-veranda/" target="_blank">chef Francis Mallmann</a>. And keeping with tradition, those mounds of beef are prepared on the parilla (grill). In honor of Miami Spice, Los Fuegos is offering some of their <a href="http://www.miamiandbeaches.com/restaurant/los-fuegos-by-francis-mallmann/119549" target="_blank">most popular dishes</a>, including the wood-oven empanada, octopus a la plancha and the wild mushroom and spinach cannelloni. </p>
                    <p>Just down the street from WPH is one of the neighborhood’s newest joints, <a href="http://izzysmiami.com/" target="_blank">Izzy’s Fish & Oyster</a>. Reminiscent of New England’s summer seafood shacks, this Miami newcomer is heavy on the clam. But with everything we’ve heard from the critics, that’s a plus. On the <a href="http://www.miamiandbeaches.com/restaurant/izzys-fish-and-oyster/117110" target="_blank">Miami Spice menu</a> are the lobster roll, oysters and <a href="http://dels.com/" target="_blank">Dels frozen lemonade</a>. Splurge with an extra order of the clam bellies. You won’t get them anywhere else but New England. </p>
                    <p>Another restaurant in Miami Beach that we’re interested in is <a href="http://naiyara.com/" target="_blank">NaiYaRa</a>. Headed by the local celebrity Chef Bee, NaiYaRa specializes in Thai street food. And while the restaurant opened among controversy and mixed reviews, it seems to have worked out the kinks, making Miami Spice the prime opportunity to get your hands on <a href="http://www.miamiandbeaches.com/special-offers/monthly-deals/miami-spice-month/miami-spice-menu?program=spice&id=118933&type=dinner" target="_blank">the dishes</a> everyone raves about, like Chef Bee’s beef jerky, curries, or the kimchee fried rice. </p>

                  <div class="post-date">July 21th, 2016</div>
                  <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/miami-events-overtown-music-and-arts-festival-2016.jpg" alt="Miami Events – Overtown Music and Arts Festival 2016" title="Miami Events – Overtown Music and Arts Festival 2016"/></p>
                  <p>Called &ldquo;a  shining example of the beauty and talent brewing within one of Miami's most  historic neighborhoods,&rdquo; by the <a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/miamis-best-concert-of-the-week-the-overtown-music-and-arts-festival-8608642" target="_blank">Miami  New Times</a>, the <strong>Overtown Music and Arts Festival</strong> is an  event you need to be at. You&rsquo;ll dance all day. You&rsquo;ll eat well and you&rsquo;ll have  your pick of some of the best local art Miami has to offer.  </p>
                  <p>Considering Overtown&rsquo;s rich, cultural  history, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the neighborhood is once again becoming a  center for arts and entertainment - driven in part by <a href="http://www.overtownmusicartsfestival.com/home/" target="_blank">the Overtown Music and  Arts Festival</a>. Formerly the Overtown Rhythm and Arts Festival, this event  grows bigger each year. Last year&rsquo;s Overtown Music and Arts Festival brought Melanie  Fiona and Mya. This year, the sixth-annual Overtown Festival is packed with  household names and grammy-winners, such as <strong>Jeremih</strong>, <strong>Estelle</strong>, <strong>Eric Benet</strong> and <strong>Kelly Price</strong>. </p>
                  <p>Yet the Overtown Music and Arts Festival  isn&rsquo;t just music. Happening <strong>Saturday,  July 23, 2016, from 11 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.</strong> this block party also features  local artists, crafts, jewelry and community organization. </p>
                  <p>Once a bustling neighborhood on par with  Harlem during its renaissance, Miami&rsquo;s Overtown neighborhood housed many of the  leading performers and intellectuals of the day, including Ella Fitzgerald, Nat  King Cole, W. E. B. Du Bois and Zora Neale Hurston. In fact, Overtown was  dubbed &ldquo;Miami&rsquo;s Little Broadway&rdquo; for its vibrant nightlife and arts scene. And  although Jim Crow had singled out Overtown as the &ldquo;colored&rdquo; area of Miami as  early as 1896, the neighborhood attracted both black and white patrons due to  the fact that it offered some of the best entertainment in the  Deep South.  </p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, starting in the late 1950s,  the construction of various highways through the middle of the neighborhood  dissected Overtown, cutting off its economic opportunity, and forcing the  neighborhood into disrepair. Fortunately for us, many Miami community leaders have  been working to revive the historic neighborhood – one such way being the  Overtown Music and Arts Festival. That said, cross the causeway and support  your community. You&rsquo;ll be glad you did. </p>
                  <p><em>For  a complete lineup and schedule, visit the Overtown Music and Arts Festival </em><a href="http://www.overtownmusicartsfestival.com/home/" target="_blank"><em>website</em></a><em>. The festival runs  from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday, July 23, 2016. Admission is free. </em></p>

                  <div class="post-date">July 19th, 2016</div>

                  <p>While Miami may have its growing share of  popular chains and well-known designers, what makes shopping in Miami the  experience we crave is this city&rsquo;s one-of-a-kind boutiques. In a place dressed  to impressed, would you expect any less? Here are our favorite shops near WPH  to stand out in the crowd.   </p>
                  <p><strong>SEE  Eyewear</strong><br>
                    <em>Lincoln  Road Mall</em><br>
                    <em>921  Lincoln Road</em><br>
                  <em>Miami  Beach, Florida 33139</em></p>
                  <p>Shades are imperative in the SoBe sun, but  not just any shades – statement shades. After all, no one will be looking at  your eyes, they&rsquo;ll be staring at your sunglasses, instead. That&rsquo;s why we like <a href="http://www.seeeyewear.com/">SEE</a> in Lincoln Park Mall. SEE always has  something unique, and more often than not, <em>too</em> many pairs that we like. To top it off, the staff is consistently accommodating.  That&rsquo;s good news considering your glasses may be the most important style item  you&rsquo;ll be carrying around South Beach. </p>
                  <p><strong>Intermix </strong><br>
                    <em>634  Collins Avenue</em><br>
                  <em>Miami  Beach, Florida 33139</em></p>
                  <p>Sometimes shopping is a chore - not here. <a href="https://www.intermixonline.com">Intermix</a> is basically a one-stop  shop, pre-curated and mixed-and-matched with styles from top designers. And  their taste is superb. Even if we&rsquo;re not looking to buy, it&rsquo;s great for  inspiration, as well. Although this happens to be another chain in SoBe, this  is one we don&rsquo;t mind. We love it too much.    </p>
                  <p><strong>Venissac</strong><br>
                    <em>1627  Washington Avenue</em><br>
                  <em>Miami  Beach, Florida 33139</em></p>
                  <p>A veteran of the Miami fashion scene,  menswear boutique <a href="http://venissac.com/">Venissac</a> is well-known for  its prints and European flair. However, no matter how versatile the clothing at  Venissac, we love it even more because it&rsquo;s designed to weather the Miami heat.  The dream is to be comfortable without looking too comfortable, and at Venissac  it&rsquo;s easy to pull that off. </p>
                  <p><strong>Taj  by Sabrina Crippa</strong><br>
                    <em>760  Ocean Drive #4</em><br>
                  <em>Miami  Beach, Florida 33139</em></p>
                  <p><a href="http://www.tajbysabrina.com/">Taj  by Sabrina</a> is the silk that luxury, beach dreams are made of.

                  <p>The tropical heat and the summer showers don&rsquo;t  bother us all too much. If fact, on certain days, we could care less.

                <p>As if it wasn&rsquo;t already ok to run around  Miami half-naked, you&rsquo;ve got another excuse this week. Starting <strong>Thursday, July 14, 2016</strong> and running  until <strong>Tuesday, July 19, 2016</strong> it&rsquo;s <strong>Miami Swim Week</strong>. </p>
                <p>This is the week where the biggest names in  swimwear will premiere trendsetting designs to style insiders, as part of <strong>SwimMiami </strong>and <strong>Funkshion</strong>. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you&rsquo;ll get in to the industry events  and champagne toasts. If you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;ll still be getting lit with all the  beautiful people at the endless pool parties. Best to don your favorite  designer and strike a pose.

                <p>The perks at WPH just keep coming. This time we’ve got brand-spankin’ new Martone bikes for your cruising pleasure – and they look GOOD.</p>
                <p>Teal-colored wheels, kelly-green frames and the Martone signature, red chains make for a standout ride - standout in the sense that WPH guests will be sure to turn heads in South Beach rolling up on one of our new bikes. </p>
                <p>Yet these Martone bikes stand out in more ways than one. The beauty of WPH’s new bikes lies not only in their eye-catching style, but also in their ingenuous design. </p>
                <p>Made of aluminum, these Martone step-throughs are lightweight and easy to ride. And the gears shift automatically, too, making an outing on one of the WPH bikes a literal breeze. We’re especially big fans of the basket on the front of each bike, perfect for stashing whatever you may find during your afternoon out and about in SoBe. </p>
                <p>Bike up to Lincoln Road Mall or cruise down Ocean Drive. Check out our favorite boutiques or meet up for brunch. Wherever you want to go in South Beach, now you can – on bike.</p>
                <p><strong>The WPH bikes are ready for play, are you?</strong></p>

                <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/favorite-clubs-in-miami-beach.jpg" alt="Our Favorite Clubs in Miami Beach" title="Our Favorite Clubs in Miami Beach"/></p>
                <p>Sure SoBe has lovely beaches, great food, history and architecture, but we know why you really came to Miami – the nightlife. We don’t blame you one bit. In fact, we’ll help you. Here are some of our top picks for the hottest spots in Miami Beach. </p>
                <p><strong>LIV</strong><br>
                  <em>4441 Collins Avenue</em> <br>
                <em>Miami Beach, Florida 33140</em></p>
                <p>Easily Miami’s most famous nightclub, LIV hosts not only some of the world’s most prominent DJs, but also the country’s most high-profile celebrities.  Don’t be surprised if you catch Chris Brown or Justin Bieber hosting, and always expect to find Cedric Gervais and Steve Angello spinning one night or another. With 18,000 square feet of neon opulence and 360-degree views, LIV is the epitome of Miami nightlife. Check the <a href="http://www.livnightclub.com/index.php/main/events" target="_blank" >upcoming schedule</a> to see who’s playing. </p>
                <p><strong>Bodega</strong><br>
                  <em>1220 16th Street</em><br>
                <em>Miami Beach, Florida 33139</em> </p>
                <p>We could rave about Bodega’s inconspicuous, speakeasy-style lounge, live music, and Latin beats, but what makes this spot stand out are its tacos. No longer do you have to stumble out of the club in search of the late-night munchies, Mexico’s ultimate drunk food awaits you in Bodega’s storefront – that is, of course, when you finally stop dancing. Once you pass through that meat locker door, it will be hard to stop – trust us. </p>
                <p><strong>Twist</strong><br>
                  <em>1057 Washington Avenue</em><br>
                <em>Miami  Beach, Florida 33139 </em></p>
                <p>If you want to dance your heart out, head to <a href="http://www.twistsobe.com/" target="_blank">Twist</a>. At South Beach’s most famous gay club, you can count on some serious moves. With multiple dance floors and different rooms spinning different tunes, from EDM to pop, hip-hop and salsa, there’s something for whatever you feel like dancing to. Even better, there’s no cover or dress code – a rarity in Miami nightlife. </p>
                <p><strong>Mokai</strong><br>
                  <em>235 23rd Street</em><br>
                <em>Miami Beach, Florida 33139</em></p>
                <p>Not to be outdone, <a href="http://www.mokaimiami.com/" target="_blank">Mokai</a> celebrity parties ooze exclusivity. Known for their Mokai Mondays, this Miami lounge offers a healthy mix of pop and hip-hop for Miami’s finest. Don’t be shied away by the amateurs complaining they couldn’t get in, any guest of WPH shouldn’t have a problem. </p>
                <p><strong>Icon</strong><br>
                  <em>1235 Washington Avenue<br>
                Miami Beach, Florida 33139</em></p>
                <p>A newcomer to the South Beach scene, Icon has the set-up (and the neon) to rival LIV in true Miami fashion. Yet <a href="http://iconmiami.com/" target="_blank">Icon</a> isn’t that new. Rising from the ashes of Miami’s long-running Mansion, Icon brings a fresh perspective to SoBe nightlife mixing Art Deco design and state-of-the-art light shows. Just down the street from WPH, Icon practically demands a visit.</p>

                <p>Now it’s even easier to play around South Beach with the newest member of WPH, the Tuk Tuk. </p>
                <p><strong>“The Tuk Tuk?! What?”</strong> you might ask. </p>
                <p>The Tuk Tuk is WPH’s new state-of-the-art shuttle, perfect for quick trips around South Beach. Wherever in the neighborhood you want to go, WPH and the Tuk Tuk will chauffer you there and pick you up, too. Tired of walking? Or just want a ride and that sea breeze in your hair, we’re on it. In the Washington Park Hotel Tuk Tuk, you’re sure to get noticed. </p>
                <p> Tour South Beach’s most iconic Art Deco buildings or get dropped off at one of the neighborhood’s superb restaurants. Or maybe you’d like us to pick you up after too much sun (or a few too many mojitos) at the beach. No worries, we’ve got this. </p>
                <p> The Tuk Tuk can take your WPH friends too. If fact, we want to. With space for up to six passengers, the Tuk Tuk is one more WPH amenity making play happen. </p>
                <p> To top it off, the eco-friendly Tuk Tuk runs on electricity. So what are you waiting for? Let WPH cart you around South Beach in the Tuk Tuk, #whereplayhappens </p>
                <p><em>To get some WPH Tuk Tuk time stop by the front desk or call (305) 421-6265, if you’re already out. Our Tuk Tuk taxis within a 10-minute radius of WPH.</em> </p>

                <p>There's plenty of great dining options in Miami, but these five restaurants take the cake.</p>
                <p><strong>Yardbird Southern Table &amp; Bar</strong><br>
                  <em>1600 Lenox Avenue<br>
                  Miami Beach, Florida 33139<br>
                Phone: 305-538-5220</em></p>
                <p>Fried chicken, shrimp and grits, chicken  and waffles, charred okra, buttermilk ranch, skillet cornbread….the list of  Southern delicacies at Yardbird seems endless. Named the best new restaurant in  2012 by the James Beard Foundation, <a href="http://runchickenrun.com/">Yardbird</a> does not disappoint – especially not the chicken. The birds at Yarbird are brined  for 27-hours before being battered and deep-fried to juicy goodness. It&rsquo;s a  Southern dream come to life in Miami Beach. </p>
                <p><strong>Pane  &amp; Vino</strong><br>
                  <em>1450  Washington Avenue</em><br>
                  <em>Miami  Beach, Florida 33139</em><br>
                <em>Phone:  305-535-9027</em> </p>
                <p>Pane &amp; Vino is some of the best Italian  you&rsquo;ll eat in Miami, and quite possibly the country, if you heed the reviews. Hailing  from Sicily, Chef Gian Paolo Ferrera prepares an authentic Italian cuisine with  modern detail. With pasta handmade daily and an ambiance that makes you feel at  home, <a href="http://www.paneevinomia.com/">Pane &amp; Vino</a> is a dining  experience that can&rsquo;t be missed. Make a reservation beforehand, as this little  gem fills up quickly. </p>
                <p><strong>Joe&rsquo;s  Stone Crab</strong><br>
                  <em>11  Washington Avenue </em><br>
                  <em>Miami  Beach, Florida 33139 </em><br>
                <em>Phone:  305 -673-0365 </em></p>
                <p>Joe&rsquo;s Stone Crab has been a Miami staple  since 1913…and an absolute must if you&rsquo;re in town during stone crab season. From  October to May, <a href="http://www.joesstonecrab.com/">Joe&rsquo;s Stone Crab</a> serves up Florida&rsquo;s most iconic crustacean with class. While Joe&rsquo;s is known for  its blue stone crab, make sure to save room for dessert - their key lime pie is  some of the best in Miami. In season, Joe&rsquo;s is THE spot in South Beach. Despite  being world-famous, this Miami favorite doesn&rsquo;t take reservations. Get there  early, and check the website beforehand as hours vary by season. </p>
                <p><strong>Prime  112</strong><br>
                  <em>112  Ocean Drive</em><br>
                  <em>Miami  Beach, Florida 33139</em><br>
                <em>Phone:  305-532-8112</em></p>
                <p>If there&rsquo;s one place on this list that  embodies the flash of Miami, Prime 112 is it. Known for its celebrity  clientele, <a href="http://mylesrestaurantgroup.com/?page_id=51">Prime 112</a> is where everyone wants to be. Prime 112 is one of the best shots in Miami for  a celebrity sighting. While there&rsquo;s no guarantee you&rsquo;ll run into Dwayne Wade  and Gabrielle Union, we&rsquo;re not saying it doesn&rsquo;t happen (often). Although  people-watching is a huge pull for this steakhouse, the menu is no slouch  either. Choose from a wide selection of steaks and seafood, and deep-fried  Oreos for dessert. Prime 112 also gets extra points for their affinity for truffle–  and extra, extra points for serving bacon while you wait. So the next time you  want to feel famous, make a reservation well in advance, dress to the nines and  head out to Prime 112.  </p>
                <p><strong>Pubbelly</strong><br>
                  <em>1418 20th Street<br>

                <em>Phone: </em><em>-305-532-7555</em></p>
                <p>Pubbelly is a refreshing take on the Miami gastro-pub.  While its array of small plates and excellent selection of craft beers and  boutique wines surpass the industry standard, <a href="http://www.pubbellyboys.com/miami/pubbelly/">Pubbelly</a> makes a bold  departure from the <a name="_GoBack"></a>standard gastro-pub fare with a menu  that spans across cultures and continents, putting a special emphasis on both  Latin and Japanese cuisines. Chefs Sergio Navarro and José Medín exquisitely  present their unique style of <em>tapas</em>,  and in turn pay homage their respective Basque and Puerto Rican cultures.</p>

Located inside the Art-Deco Freehand Hotel, this bar is complete with Acapulco chairs, a lounge pool and mood lighting. Pick and choose from their Western Tiki Menu, or go big and order the daily punch bowl inside this tropical-kitsch paradise.</p>

                <p><strong>The Rooftop Bar - Juvia</strong></p>
                <p>With its trendy white-and-purple lounge and vertical garden, this chic rooftop restaurant and bar is gorgeous -- and so Miami. Situated on top of the Lincoln Road Mall parking garage, <a href="http://www.juviamiami.com/" target="_blank">Juvia</a> offers some of the best views of both Miami and Miami Beach. If you’re headed out to the club, this is definitely the spot to stop at for an exclusive cocktail and a few bites of Juvia’s unique French, Japanese and Peruvian fusion.</p>

                <p><strong>The Neighborhood Bar - Sweet Liberty</strong></p>
                <p>This locals’ bar is on point -- and open late. Both <a href="http://mysweetliberty.com/" target="_blank">Sweet Liberty’s</a> kitchen and bar stay open until about 4 am, making this an excellent option for eating and drinking until the wee hours. While all these options are perks, what makes Sweet Liberty stand out is its service and unpretentious vibe. There’s always favorite tunes spinning and friends to be made in this Collins Park hotspot.</p>
                <p class="font-italic">Sweet Liberty, 237-B 20th Street, Miami Beach, FL 33139</p>
                <p><strong>The Newbie Bar - Able & Baker</strong></p>
                <p>Touted as a Japanese speakeasy, <a href="http://www.ableandbakermiami.com/" target="_blank">Able & Baker</a> is a newcomer to the Miami scene. But don’t let that deter you. Bathed in mid-century modern with touches of Asian flare, Able & Baker makes for an excellent bar scene, especially with its unique list of ginger-infused cocktails and its cosmopolitan wine list.  Make sure to check the website for the bar’s upcoming events, like its weekly Brazilian beats or its Saturday night dance party, TropicThunda.</p>
                <p class="font-italic">Able & Baker, 920 Alton Road, Miami Beach, FL 33139</p>
                <p><strong>The Tride & True Bar - Smith & Wollensky</strong></p>
                <p>This is the place to kick back and take in the sunset. Located along the water at South Pointe Park, <a href="http://www.smithandwollensky.com/our-restaurants/miami-beach/" target="_blank">Smith & Wollensky</a> is the place to watch the cruise ships set sail. Although Smith & Wollensky has a great selection of seafood and steaks and some to-die-for truffle mac & cheese, if you want to get a seat outside, it’s best to come for cocktails outside of dinner hours. They’ve got a great list of classic drinks as well as some more modern twists.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-heading">Celebrate Cuba’s Golden Age with WPH</h2>
                <div class="post-date">May 2nd, 2016</div>
                <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/celebrate-cuba.jpg" alt="Celebrate Cuba’s Golden Age with WPH" title="Celebrate Cuba’s Golden Age with WPH"/></p>
                <p>On <strong>Thursday, May 5, 2016</strong>, our friends at the Wolfsonian-FIU unveil their <a href="http://www.wolfsonian.org/explore/exhibitions/promising-paradise-cuban-allure-american-seduction" target="_blank">newest exhibition</a>, “Promising Paradise: Cuban Allure, American Seduction,” and Washington Park Hotel is throwing the after party. </p>
                <p>“Promising Paradise: Cuban Allure, American Seduction” chronicles Cuba’s golden age of tourism in which Cuba attracted American elite, gangsters and celebrities, starting with the onset of Prohibition up until the Cuban Revolution.</p>
                <p>Although the United States tried to restrict many diversions in the first half of the 20th century, rich Americans found an easily-accessible escape in Cuba’s tropical playground of bars, casinos, and nightlife.</p>
                <p>Romantically referred to as the “Pearl of the Antilles,” Cuba was the exotic paradise for many Americans in this short-lived snippet of history. The Wolfsonian-FIU is bringing some of that appeal back with its collection of photographs, posters and <a href="http://www.wolfsonian.org/research-library/research-at-the-museum/special-collections-and-archives/the-vicki-gold-levi-collection" target="_blank">ephemeral pieces</a>, such as guidebooks, newspaper clippings, sheet music, and postcards from this bygone period in the 20th century.</p>
                <p>The festivities start at <strong>6:30 pm at the Wolfsonian-FIU</strong> with the <a href="http://www.wolfsonian.org/events/member-exclusive-preview-party-promising-paradise" target="_blank">exclusive preview</a> of the exhibition. There will be performances by Arthur Murray and music by SonCubano.</p>
                <p><strong>At 8:30 pm, the party moves to WPH</strong>. We’re just across Washington Avenue, catty-corner to the museum. Have a mojito in honor of the event, or your choice of beer or wine. Dance a little to the beats put on by our DJ and get a closer look at what WPH has to offer. After all, WPH is #WherePlayHappens. You can even stay the night if you want.</p>
                <p class="font-italic">For those of you that can’t make the opening, the exhibition opens to the general public on May 6, 2016 and runs until August 21, 2016. As always, all WPH guests receive free admission to the Wolfsonian-FIU.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-heading">Washington Park Picks: Little Havana</h2>
                <div class="post-date">April 26th, 2016</div>
                <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/washington-park-picks-1.jpg" alt="Washington Park Picks: Little Havana" title="Washington Park Picks: Little Havana"/></p>
                <p>One of the most vibrant parts of the city is just a short trip from WPH. The unofficial capital of Cuba in the United States, Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood is rich with culture, food and history. Although WPH is #WherePlayHappens there’s plenty of fun to be had in this iconic neighborhood across the causeway.</p>
                <p>While in Little Havana, here are some things you won’t want to miss:</p>
                <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/washington-park-picks-2.jpg" alt="Washington Park Picks: Little Havana" title="Washington Park Picks: Little Havana"/></p>
                <p class="font-italic"><strong>See:</strong></p>
                <p>Máximo Gómez Park<br>
                  <span class="font-italic">801 SW 15th Avenue</span> </p>
                  <p>Better known as Domino Park, this park sets the scene for the images most associated with Little Havana – old men entrenched in heated games of dominos, with the smell of strong coffee and cigars not far off. Stay and watch for a while.</p>
                  <p>Cubaocho<br>
                    <span class="font-italic">1465 SW 8th Street</span> </p>
                    <p>This museum/bar/cultural center is the one-stop shop for all things Cuban. Founded by Cuban refugee and art collector Roberto Ramos, <a href="http://www.cubaocho.com/" target="_blank">Cubaocho</a> is a far cry from any other cultural center in the United States, mixing history, art, cultural expression and live entertainment in one place. It is a must for anyone who wants the Little Havana experience. Cubaocho also holds a salsa night every Thursday, called “Let’s Dance Miami.”</p>
                    <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/washington-park-picks-3.jpg" alt="Washington Park Picks: Little Havana" title="Washington Park Picks: Little Havana"/></p>
                    <p class="font-italic"><strong>Do:</strong></p>
                    <p>Little Havana Art Walk<br>
                      <span class="font-italic">1637 SW 8th Street</span> </p>
                      <p>Every 2nd Friday of the month, the neighborhood holds The Little Havana Art Walk. The galleries and workshops that line both the famous Calle Ocho and the 12th & 6th Arts District give visitors the opportunity to converse with some of Cuba’s most talented artists, including the renown <a href="http://www.agustingainza.com/" target="_blank">Agustín Gaínza</a>. A complete list of all Little Havana galleries can be found <a href="http://www.littlehavanaguide.com/things-to-do/visit-art-studios-and-galleries/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                      <p>Hoy Como Ayer<br>
                        <span class="font-italic">2212 SW 8th Street</span> </p>
                        <p>A few salsas are a must while in Little Havana, as this signature Latin dance takes on a distinct form in la salsa Cubana. The popular club <a href="http://www.hoycomoayer.us/" target="_blank">Hoy Como Ayer</a> features live bands and other popular latin music.</p>
                        <p>Ball & Chain<br>
                          <span class="font-italic">1513 SW 8th Street</span> </p>
                          <p>The historic <a href="http://ballandchainmiami.com/" target="_blank">Ball & Chain</a> boasts guests such as Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, as well as some of the best live music in Miami. However, what keeps patrons coming back are its cocktails. Order the mojito.</p>
                          <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/washington-park-picks-4.jpg" alt="Washington Park Picks: Little Havana" title="Washington Park Picks: Little Havana"/></p>

                          <p>Versailles<br>
                            <span class="font-italic">3555 SW 8th Street</span> </p>
                            <p>You can’t go to Little Havana and not go to Versailles. Versailles Restaurant is easily the unofficial soapbox of the neighborhood. Not surprisingly, it’s also the preferred spot of local politicians and heads of state alike. Order a cortadito and a cubano and see what you happen to overhear, or just who you happen to see.</p>
                            <p>La Carreta<br>
                              <span class="font-italic">3632 SW 8th Street</span> </p>
                              <p>While a visit to the well-known Versailles is imperative while in Little Havana, don’t overlook other local favorites such as La Carreta, whose signature dish is ropa vieja, a traditional Cuban dish of shredded beef in a tomato sauce. Visit the original location on Calle Ocho.</p>
                              <p>Tinta y Café<br>
                                <span class="font-italic">276 SW 8th Street</span> </p>
                                <p>For something a little more modern, visit the artsy Tinta y Café. This bistro fuses New American and Cuban cuisines, making it a perfect place to grab a bite before the weekly festival, <a href="http://viernesculturales.org/mainvc/" target="_blank">Viernes Culturales</a>. They have excellent coffee, too. </p>
                                <p>Azucar<br>
                                  <span class="font-italic">1503 SW 8th Street</span> </p>
                                  <p>When it comes to ice cream in Little Havana, there’s one place that you have to go --  Azucar’s Ice Cream Company. Cuban ice cream just tastes better – probably because of the copious amounts of eggs and spices. Add that to Azucar’s vast array of flavors, ranging from local favorites Abuela Maria, Café con Leche and Mantecado to more adventurous concoctions like Sweet Potato Ancho Chile Chocolate Chip or Olive Oil, Orange Zest and Dark Chocolate, and you’ll be coming back for more.</p>

                                  <h2 class="blog-heading">Washington Park Picks: The Art Deco District</h2>
                                  <div class="post-date">April 19th, 2016</div>
                                  <p><img src="/assets/images/blog/the-art-deco-district.jpg" alt="Washington Park Picks: The Art Deco District" title="Washington Park Picks: The Art Deco District"/></p>
                                  <p>If it weren’t for the Great Miami Hurricane, the Art Deco District may have never been born. While the hurricane destroyed much of 1926 Miami, it also gave architects an empty playground to experiment with a new style made famous by the 1925 Paris exhibition <span class="font-italic">Internationale des Artes Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes</span> -- Art Deco for short. This Gatsby-esque design burst onto the empty streets of Miami with its sharp angles, geometric shapes and sleek, efficient lines. Later, it would be coated in colorful neon, adding a touch that was and still is iconic Miami.</p>
                                  <p>Washington Park Hotel is located in the heart of this historic architectural district, making it a perfect launching point for a walking tour through this distinct neighborhood. Allow us to suggest some points of interest within walking distance of the hotel:</p>
                                  <p><strong>The Wolfsonian</strong><br>
                                    <span class="font-italic">1001 Washington Avenue</span> </p>
                                    <p>Run by Florida International University, this museum takes a particular interest in design. With its vast collection of Art Deco items, <a href="http://www.wolfsonian.org/" target="_blank">the Wolfsonian</a> is an excellent place to get a background on the movement before venturing outside. Free admission for all Washington Park Hotel guests.</p>
                                    <p><strong>The McAlpin</strong><br>
                                      <span class="font-italic">1424 Ocean Drive</span></p>
                                      <p>The McAlpin could easily be named the definitive building of the Miami Art Deco Movement. Its pastel pink and sea-green color blocks are classic Miami, while its geometric shapes and horizontal lines are textbook examples of Art Deco. It figures as the McAlpin was designed by L. Murray Dixon, one of the architects behind much of South Beach.</p>
                                      <p><strong>The Cavalier</strong><br>
                                        <span class="font-italic">1320 Ocean Drive</span></p>
                                        <p>The Cavalier is another iconic slice of South Beach Art Deco. What stands out on the Cavalier are its vibrant patterns planted on the building’s all white façade, created in honor of the archeological discoveries of the period. Pops of bright turquoise, red and yellow make this structure worth viewing.</p>
                                        <p><strong>The Breakwater</strong><br>
                                          <span class="font-italic">940 Ocean Drive</span></p>
                                          <p>This is a building that’s much better at night. Why? Because it’s covered in neon. The Breakwater beams yellow rays into the Miami sky as its fluorescent-blue lettering spells out its name for all the boardwalk to see.</p>
                                          <p><strong>The Waldorf Towers</strong><br>
                                            <span class="font-italic">860 Ocean Drive</span></p>
                                            <p>Almost demolished, the Waldorf Towers is one of the more nautical buildings on the list, especially with its striking Art Deco-style lighthouse. The building’s rounded corners and orange-dreamsicle façade secures its title as Miami Beach Tropical Deco.</p>

                                            <p>Washington Park Hotel is going all out this weekend – for PRIDE, Miami Beach’s annual LGBTQ celebration. Miami Beach PRIDE is one of the best parties out there – and we’re proud to be a sponsor of the event. We love PRIDE. The costumes are incredible, the people gorgeous and the DJs world-class. It’s a party that only Miami can throw. And after all, we like to be <strong>#WherePlayHappens</strong>.</p>
                                            <p>All partying aside, we believe in supporting our vibrant community in any way we can, especially if it’s through PRIDE Weekend. <strong>Stop by and see us at the Washington Park Hotel booth located at space #19.</strong> We’ll be there both Saturday and Sunday (April 9 & 10) giving away premium stays at WPH, as well as other WPH swag. Spin the wheel and win WPH water bottles, luggage tags, koozies and more, or enter to win a 2-night-stay at WPH in one of our premium rooms.</p>
                                            <p>We’re also offering a <strong>25% discount on all guestrooms at WPH during PRIDE Weekend.</strong> So whether you’re coming from near or far, our beachy chic doors are open. Drench yourself in our rainfall showers, cozy up in one of our guestrooms and take in the views of South Beach after a long day at PRIDE. We’re pet friendly, too.</p>
                                            <p>The three-day festivities kick off on Friday, April 8, with a red-carpet reception from 2016 PRIDE Grand Marshal and host of the country’s #1 radio show, Elvis Duran.</p>
                                            <p>However, what we’re really looking forward to is <strong>the festival on Saturday and Sunday at Lummus Park.</strong> Beach parties don’t get much better. Jordin Sparks is performing and so are some of the best DJs in the business – DJ Miik and DJ Maryalice, just to namedrop a few. The PRIDE dancers will be there as well.</p>
                                            <p>Another pretty big perk is that 100% of all the festival’s alcohol sales go to PRIDE. Drink up! WPH is only a few blocks away. Wake up refreshed on Sunday and ready for the PRIDE parade – a must in Miami Beach. Stay for the Block Party on Ocean Drive, too.</p>
                                            <p>All of Miami will be there. Will you?</p>
